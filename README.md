com_daily_stats
===============

Chart drawing Jommla 2.5 component based on the Joomla Plotalot component (http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/living/education-a-culture/graphs-and-charts/11717). The com_daily_stats component graphically diaplays article related historical data. The data was created by a daily cron calling some php code (not part of the com_daily_stats component).

A demo of the most recent version is available at http://plusconscient.net/joo25/?Itemid=229

The demo is hosted on the in construction Joomla 2.5 version of the http://plusconscient.net Joomla 1.5 site. The article describe the associated spoken audio file freely available for streaming and download. Note that the Joomla 2.5 version does not yet propose neither an audio player, nor a download link.

On the demo, two charts display the daily hits and dowloads for each article. The ploted data are generated by a daily cron job which triggers some php/sql to insert per article daily snapshots in a db table. In the demo, you first select a category and then an article in this category. Checking the "Chart whole category£" check box plots the sum value of all the articles of the selected category. "All categories" plots the entire site hit and download values.
